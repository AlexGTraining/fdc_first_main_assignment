            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
            Zoe Saldana was born on June 19, 1978 in Passaic, New Jersey, to Asalia
            Nazario and Aridio Salda√±a. Her father was Dominican and her mother is
            Puerto Rican. She was raised in Queens, New York. When she was 10 years
            old, she and her family moved to the Dominican Republic, where they
            would live for the next seven years. While living there, Zoe discovered
            a keen interest in performance dance and began her training at the
            prestigious ECOS Espacio de Danza Dance Academy where she learned ballet
            as well as other dance forms. Not only did her training provide an
            excellent outlet for the enthusiastic and energetic youngster, it would
            also prove to be a fortunate precursor for the start of her professional
            acting career. At age 17, Zoe and her family moved back to the United
            States where her love for dance followed and an interest in theater
            performance became stronger.
